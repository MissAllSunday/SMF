	About this repo:
	----------------
	
It is a modified version of the well known SMF forum software that is now released
under a open source compatible BSD license.

http://www.simplemachines.org/ is where the original SMF can be found.

The goal of this project is to create a more modern version of SMF with an emphasize
on enduser usability. 

Some things that are already implemented or planned are:

* Content rating system (can be a simple "like" system or something more
  advanced).
* A topic tagging system
* A completely new theme, HTML 5 compliant and targeted at modern 
  browsers
* integrated the Smarty template engine for easier templating.
* Template hooks allow inserting template fragments in many locations.
* dynamic auto-refreshing relative time stamps.
* sphinx search support for fast fulltext searching.
* Moderation enhancements: Topic bans allow to ban a single member from one
  or more specific topic(s) only.
* removed lots of legacy code. Needs PHP 5.3 and MySQL 5.0 (or any later version)
* Plugin architecture that allows for mods w/o the need for code edits.
